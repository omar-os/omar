# OMAR Mission Control

OMAR Mission Control is the first web client for authoring and observing
principled OMAR topology programs. It pairs a conversational workflow-builder
surface with an LF-inspired live diagram of ports, reactions, and connections.

Includes:

- a workflow builder that drafts an OMAR program for you to confirm;
- run admission against `omar serve`, then live observation of that run;
- an LF-inspired diagram: ELK layout drawn as SVG, no KIELER/KLighD;
- live tag, reaction, value, and execution status;
- a fixed-viewport three-panel workspace;
- CI that lints, builds, contract-tests the protocol, and drives the whole
  flow end to end in a browser without invoking a model.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.13 or newer. Everything below runs from `web/`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. With no flag it runs the offline demo topology:
you can draft and inspect, but not run.

## Two builds of the same application

`npm run build` produces the Cloudflare Worker: server-rendered, deployed, and
told the daemon's address at launch through `OMAR_SERVE_URL`.

`npm run build:spa` produces a static bundle entered from the browser, which
`omar serve --ui` embeds and hands out from its own port. There the page is
same-origin with the API, so it reads the address from the page it was served
by and there is no mode to choose. `spa/main.tsx` is that entry; it renders the
same `Studio` component.

The bundle is gzipped by `build/compress-spa.mjs` and embedded under the
runtime's `ui` cargo feature, so a plain `cargo build` needs no Node.

## Running it

Mode is chosen at launch, not in the UI. To run for real, use `make dev` from
the repository root — it builds the runtime, starts the daemon, starts Mission
Control pointed at it, and opens a browser. Ctrl-C stops both.

```bash
make dev
```

`OMAR_SERVE_ADDRESS`, `OMAR_WEB_PORT` and `OMAR_DEV_OPEN=0` adjust it. The two
halves separately, if you want them in separate terminals:

```bash
cargo run --bin omar -- serve --address 127.0.0.1:7340   # from the repository root
OMAR_SERVE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7340 npm run dev         # from web/
```

The topbar shows the mode and whether the daemon is reachable, polled every few
seconds. Describe a workflow, then **Confirm & run**. Mission Control posts the
program to `/v1/runs`; `omar serve` compiles it, starts the run, and returns
that run's `diagram_address`, which the client observes over `/v1/diagram` and
`/v1/events`.

Nothing executes before the confirmation step, and the confirm button stays
disabled unless the daemon is live. Both runtime surfaces are loopback-only.

## Saved conversations

**History** lists this runtime's chats. Start a **New chat**, search by title,
or reopen an earlier conversation. Messages, commentary, diagram selections,
and proposed programs (including inputs and topology previews) are saved
before they are acknowledged, in `~/.omar/ea/<id>/chats.json` under the
configured OMAR state directory. The file is private to the local user.

Reloads and daemon restarts retain the transcript. Continuing a restored chat
starts a fresh assistant and supplies its saved context. Reopening a proposal
never deploys it. Wait for the current reply or run to finish before switching;
all browser tabs connected to this EA follow the same active conversation.

This saves Mission Control conversation context, not provider-internal model
state, terminal scrollback, unsent composer text, manual source edits, or live
run execution state. Chats already lost before this feature was installed
cannot be recovered from memory. A corrupt or unwritable history file produces
an error rather than silently replacing saved conversations.

## Architecture

`app/lib/protocol.ts` holds both contracts: diagram protocol v1 and the
`omar serve` run-admission API. `app/lib/runtime-client.ts` admits runs, polls
run records, loads snapshots, and subscribes to server-sent events.
`app/diagram/diagram-canvas.tsx` maps topology nodes into an ELK graph and draws
the result as SVG.

`app/lib/design-agent.ts` is the drafting seam. `scriptedDesignAgent` returns a
fixed program, and a model-backed agent replaces it without touching the
confirm/spawn state machine — which is why the end-to-end test can drive the
code that ships.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # unit + protocol contract tests, incl. a build
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright: prompt -> design -> confirm -> deploy -> finished
npm run test:conformance   # the fake vs. the real daemon (needs the runtime)
```

The browser tests drive a fake `omar serve`, which is what makes them fast and
model-free — and only as truthful as the fake is. `test:conformance` is what
keeps it honest: it starts the **real** daemon alongside the fake and asserts
they answer identically, so a changed status code, error shape, or field name
in the runtime fails here rather than leaving the browser suite green over a
broken integration.

It invokes no model. Two tricks cover the whole path:

- a program naming a backend the runtime cannot resolve fails before any agent
  starts, exercising admission, compilation and failure reporting;
- a team of `Stub` agents runs to completion, so `run_started` through
  `run_completed` is observed on a real stream.

It runs against the runtime built from this same commit, which is the point of
keeping them in one repository:

```bash
(cd .. && cargo build --bin omar) && (cd ../lang && lake build omarc)
npm run test:conformance
```

It skips itself when those binaries are absent, so a Node-only checkout is
unaffected. `OMAR_BIN` and `OMARC_BIN` override the paths.

`tests/fixtures/diagram-snapshot.v1.json` was captured from a real `omar serve`
run. `tests/protocol-contract.test.mjs` asserts the client's and renderer's
requirements against it, so a runtime field rename fails here rather than
silently. `tests/fake-serve.mjs` replays that snapshot over the real wire
protocol, which is how the browser test runs without a model, a Lean toolchain,
or tmux.
