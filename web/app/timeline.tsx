/**
 * The logical timeline of a program: every tag it passes through, in order.
 *
 * Before anything is deployed these are projected — worked out from the program
 * rather than observed, which is possible because what decides a tag is the
 * program and not what an agent says. Stepping through them is the determinism
 * claim made checkable: this is what will happen, and here it is before it has.
 *
 * Once a run is live the same strip follows it. Same steps, same order; what
 * changes is that a position is now a fact rather than a prediction, and the
 * strip moves on its own. That the two are the same list is the point — a live
 * run that departed from its projection would be visible here as a mismatch,
 * rather than being invisible because projection and observation were drawn by
 * different things.
 *
 * An input arriving mid-run makes the tail of this wrong, so the projection is
 * recomputed and the strip redrawn from where the run actually is.
