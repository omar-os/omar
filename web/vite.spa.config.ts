 * The browser-entered build of the same application, for `omar serve --ui`.

 * `vite.config.ts` builds the Worker: server-rendered, deployed, and told the
 * daemon's address at launch. This one is a static bundle the daemon itself
 * hands out, so it is entered from `spa/index.html` and reads the address from
 * the page it was served by.
 *
 * Output names are fixed rather than hashed, and dynamic imports are inlined,
 * so what lands in `dist/spa` is a known list of files the runtime can embed
 * without a manifest. Cache-busting buys nothing on loopback.
