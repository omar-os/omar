**LLM agents are unpredictable. Their coordination doesn't have to be.**

**`omar` delivers deterministic, formally specified orchestration for multi-agent systems.**

## Features

- **Deep hierarchies**: Agents managing agents, just like a company.
- **Heterogeneity**: Let `claude`, `codex`, and other agents collaborate as a team.
- **Full control**: Talk to and control any subagent you want.
- **Life span**: Long-running or ephemeral agents, your choice.
- **Isolation**: Give each team its own git worktree or docker container. See [docs/isolation.md](docs/isolation.md).
- **Customization**: Support all `tmux` commands you love.

Other features include messaging systems integration (e.g., Slack), computer use, and more.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- tmux 3.0+
- Rust 1.70+
- GNU Make
- Node.js 22.13+ (to build Mission Control, which `make build` embeds)
- One or more coding agents [listed here](#supported-agent-backends).

### One-liner (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://omar.rs/install.sh | sh
```

Installs all binaries to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install omar-os/omar/omar
```

### Build from source

Requires Rust 1.70+ and GNU Make.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omar-os/omar.git
cd omar && make install
```

## Quick Start

#### Step 1: Launch Mission Control

```bash
$ omar serve --ui
```

Serves the web UI from the daemon's own address and opens it in your browser.

#### Step 2: Describe a workflow

Type what the team should do. The assistant drafts an OMAR program and shows you
the topology it compiles to.
Nothing runs until you press **Confirm deploy**,
then the diagram goes live.

### Terminal UI (Legacy)

Note: The legacy terminal UI does not yet implement the deterministic model in the mission control.

#### Step 1: Launch `omar`

```bash
$ omar
```

Go [here](#supported-agent-backends) to see how to launch with specific agent backends.

#### Step 2: Tell the Executive Assistant (EA) to run a test prompt.

Copy the following into the EA window:
```
Run https://github.com/omar-os/omar/blob/main/prompts/tests/project-factory.md
```

You should see agents being spawned by the EA.

Tip: Use `↑↓←→` to cycle through agents at the current level. Use `Tab` to drill into a deeper level. Use `Shift+Tab` to back out.

#### Step 3: Shutdown the project.

Go back to the EA and type in:
```
Shutdown the test project and its agents.
```
