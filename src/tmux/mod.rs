/// Readiness markers for each supported backend — strings that must ALL
/// appear in a backend's rendered TUI before the pane is considered ready
/// to accept input. Single source of truth used by both the API's
/// `spawn_agent` path and the CLI `manager::spawn_worker` path.
///
/// For Claude Code specifically we require both the product banner
/// ("Claude Code") AND the input-widget prompt glyph ("❯"): on v2.1.116
/// the banner renders several hundred ms before the input widget is
/// actually wired up to accept keystrokes, so matching only on "Claude
/// Code" lets `deliver_prompt` fire Enter into a pane that silently
/// swallows it. "❯" is drawn by Claude Code as the leading character of
/// the input line and only appears once the widget has been laid out,
/// making it a reliable readiness signal that survives tmux config
/// differences (unlike the "? for shortcuts" hint, which Claude Code
/// replaces with a `tmux focus-events off` warning on stock Ubuntu tmux
/// configs — rendering that marker absent on Linux and stalling
/// `wait_for_markers` for its full timeout).
