//! Generating the client's protocol from this one.
//!
//! The wire types were written twice — once here as Rust, once in
//! `web/app/lib/protocol.ts` as TypeScript — and only the second copy was ever
//! checked against anything. Nothing made them agree, so they drifted: the
//! daemon answered `stopped` for as long as `RunEnd::Stopped` has existed, and
//! no client had that status written down at all.
//!
//! This emits the TypeScript from the Rust, and the test at the bottom fails
//! when the checked-in file is not what this run produces. The generated file
//! is committed rather than built, because `web.yml`'s Node jobs have no Rust
//! toolchain and must not need one.
//!
//! Vocabularies get a runtime array as well as a type:
//!
//! ```text
//! export const RUN_STATUSES = ["starting", ...] as const;
//! export type RunStatus = (typeof RUN_STATUSES)[number];
//! ```
//!
//! A type alone would not have caught the bug it was written for. TypeScript
//! erases types at build time, and the check that rejected `stopped` was a
//! runtime one — a hand-written list inside `assertRunRecord`. The array is
//! what that check can be written against.
