//! The Mission Control bundle `omar serve` hands out.
//!
//! Served from the daemon's own port, so the page is same-origin with the API
//! it calls: no CORS, and the address is read from the page rather than chosen
//! at launch. That is the whole reason this exists rather than pointing a
//! separately-started dev server at the daemon.
//!
//! The bytes are stored gzipped and handed out gzipped, which is what keeps the
//! binary about 0.7MB larger rather than 2.2MB. Every browser has understood
//! `Content-Encoding: gzip` for twenty years, and this only ever answers
//! loopback, so there is no client here that cannot read it.
//!
//! Built by `npm run build:spa` in `web/`, embedded only under the `ui`
//! feature: a plain `cargo build` needs no Node.
